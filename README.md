2. UML stands for Unified Modeling Language, which is a graphical language used to model and describe software systems. UML provides a standardized way of visualizing the design of a software system, including its structure, behavior, and interactions between objects. UML diagrams can be used to model various aspects of a software system, including Class diagrams, which model the classes, attributes, and methods of a system, and the relationships between them.

3. Domain-Driven Design (DDD) is an approach to software development that focuses on modeling the core business concepts and processes in a software system. DDD is based on the idea that the most important aspect of software design is understanding the problem domain, and that this understanding should be the driving force behind the design and development of the software.
